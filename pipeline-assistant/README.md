# Pipeline Assistant

A project to explore concepts related to the design and implementation of the deployment pipeline. I will use this project to share my knowledge around the deployment pipeline, explore new approaches, and as support of my talks, presentations, posts ... 

The intended deployment pipeline will support applications, databases and infrastructure changes. 
## Deplyment Pipeline

The deployment pipeline has the following stages:

1. Source Control
2. Continuous Integration
3. Continuous Delivery

## Database

### Database migrations
