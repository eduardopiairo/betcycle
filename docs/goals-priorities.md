# BetCycle: Measurable Goals and Priorities for Key Areas

This document defines measurable goals for each key area in the BetCycle project. Goals are actionable, with clear outcomes, and are prioritized based on importance and logical progression.

---

## Local Development & Exploration
**Priority**: High (Foundation for the project)
- **Goals**:
  - [ ] Set up a reproducible local development environment using Docker or Vagrant.
  - [ ] Run a prototype "Hello World" application locally.
  - [ ] Create a Git repository to version the project code.
  - [ ] Document the local setup process in a `README.md`.

---

## Continuous Integration (CI)
**Priority**: High (Fast feedback loops for developers)
- **Goals**:
  - [ ] Set up a CI tool (e.g., GitHub Actions, CircleCI).
  - [ ] Write a pipeline to:
    - [ ] Automate unit testing.
    - [ ] Perform linting and code formatting.
    - [ ] Generate code coverage reports.
  - [ ] Enforce CI checks as a pre-requisite for merging pull requests.
  - [ ] Document how to extend or modify the CI pipeline.

---

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
**Priority**: High (Critical for scalability and consistency)
- **Goals**:
  - [ ] Choose an IaC tool (e.g., Terraform, Pulumi).
  - [ ] Write scripts to provision:
    - [ ] A staging environment.
    - [ ] A production environment.
  - [ ] Automate infrastructure provisioning using the CI/CD pipeline.
  - [ ] Document the IaC setup and deployment process.

---

## Policies as Code
**Priority**: Medium (Enforces governance and compliance)
- **Goals**:
  - [ ] Implement a policy-as-code tool (e.g., Open Policy Agent, Sentinel).
  - [ ] Define policies to:
    - [ ] Enforce CI/CD checks before deployment.
    - [ ] Restrict deployments to approved branches.
    - [ ] Monitor infrastructure for compliance violations.
  - [ ] Integrate policy checks into CI/CD pipelines.
  - [ ] Document the policies and how to modify them.

---

## Continuous Delivery (CD)
**Priority**: High (Streamlines deployments)
- **Goals**:
  - [ ] Extend the CI pipeline to:
    - [ ] Build artifacts (e.g., Docker images).
    - [ ] Push artifacts to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, ECR).
  - [ ] Automate deployment to staging after a successful build.
  - [ ] Implement manual approval steps for production deployments.
  - [ ] Test deployment rollback strategies.

---

## Internal Developer Platform (IDP)
**Priority**: Medium (Improves developer productivity)
- **Goals**:
  - [ ] Set up a platform like Backstage or create a custom developer portal.
  - [ ] Provide self-service templates for:
    - [ ] Creating new pipelines.
    - [ ] Deploying new environments.
  - [ ] Write onboarding documentation for developers.
  - [ ] Collect feedback from developers to improve the platform.

---

## Kubernetes
**Priority**: High (Essential for containerized application scaling)
- **Goals**:
  - [ ] Set up a Kubernetes cluster (Minikube for local, EKS/GKE/AKS for cloud).
  - [ ] Write Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts for the application.
  - [ ] Deploy the application to Kubernetes.
  - [ ] Scale the application to handle increased load.
  - [ ] Document the Kubernetes setup and deployment process.

---

## Monitoring & Observability
**Priority**: High (Ensures reliability and debugging capabilities)
- **Goals**:
  - **Metrics**:
    - [ ] Set up Prometheus and Grafana for real-time metrics.
    - [ ] Monitor application and infrastructure performance (e.g., CPU, memory, response times).
  - **Logging**:
    - [ ] Implement centralized logging using ELK Stack, Fluentd, or Loki.
    - [ ] Aggregate and analyze logs for debugging.
  - **Tracing**:
    - [ ] Use Jaeger or OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing across microservices.
  - **Alerting**:
    - [ ] Configure alerts for critical metrics (e.g., pipeline failures, resource exhaustion).
  - **Dashboards**:
    - [ ] Build actionable dashboards to visualize metrics, logs, and traces.
  - **Documentation**:
    - [ ] Write guides on interpreting metrics and logs for incident response.

---

## Security & Compliance
**Priority**: High (Critical for trust and reliability)
- **Goals**:
  - **Application Security**:
    - [ ] Integrate static code analysis tools (e.g., Snyk, SonarQube) into pipelines.
    - [ ] Run dynamic security tests on running applications (e.g., OWASP ZAP).
  - **Dependency Management**:
    - [ ] Monitor dependencies for vulnerabilities using Dependabot or Renovate.
  - **Container Security**:
    - [ ] Scan container images with tools like Trivy or Aqua Security.
    - [ ] Implement runtime protection for containerized workloads.
  - **Secrets Management**:
    - [ ] Set up a secure secrets management tool (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).
  - **Compliance**:
    - [ ] Define and enforce compliance requirements such as SOC2, GDPR.
    - [ ] Use policy-as-code tools to manage compliance rules.
  - **Documentation**:
    - [ ] Write security best practices and onboarding guides.

---

## Cost Management
**Priority**: Medium (Optimizes resource utilization and budgets)
- **Goals**:
  - [ ] Set up cost monitoring tools (e.g., AWS Cost Explorer, GCP Billing Reports).
  - [ ] Identify and eliminate unused resources (e.g., orphaned instances, volumes).
  - [ ] Establish budget alerts for staging and production environments.
  - [ ] Document cost-saving strategies for developers and operators.

---

## Finalization and Continuous Improvement
**Priority**: Low (Ongoing refinement)
- **Goals**:
  - [ ] Collect feedback from developers and stakeholders on BetCycle.
  - [ ] Identify and resolve bottlenecks in pipelines, platforms, or deployments.
  - [ ] Regularly update tools and practices based on new trends and learnings.
  - [ ] Write a case study or postmortem on the BetCycle project.
