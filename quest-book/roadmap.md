# BetCycle Roadmap: From Exploration to Production

This roadmap outlines the journey of BetCycle, covering all stages from local development to production deployment. It includes milestones, tools, and tasks categorized by focus areas.

---

## Phase 1: **Local Development & Exploration**
- **Goal**: Set up a local environment that mirrors production as much as possible.
- **Milestones**:
  - [ ] Choose a project to implement (e.g., a web app, API, or microservice).
  - [ ] Set up a reproducible development environment using:
    - Docker (for containerization)
    - VS Code or JetBrains IDEs (for productivity)
  - [ ] Implement a basic feature and ensure it runs locally.
  - [ ] Document the setup process in a `README.md`.

---

## Phase 2: **Application Development (3-Layer Architecture)**
- **Goal**: Design and build a 3-layer application (data, backend, frontend) with a betting theme for major cycling events (Tour de France, Giro d’Italia, and Vuelta a España).

### Data Layer:
- **Milestones**:
  - [ ] Define the database schema for cycling events, participants, and bets.
  - [ ] Choose and set up a database solution (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB).
  - [ ] Write scripts for ingesting and updating race data (e.g., live APIs or web scraping).
  - [ ] Expose data access through APIs (e.g., REST or GraphQL).

### Backend Layer:
- **Milestones**:
  - [ ] Define core business logic:
    - User registration and authentication.
    - Placing and managing bets.
    - Calculating odds and payouts.
  - [ ] Choose a backend framework (e.g., Node.js, Django, Spring Boot).
  - [ ] Build APIs for frontend communication (e.g., REST or GraphQL).
  - [ ] Integrate with the data layer for accessing and updating information.
  - [ ] Write unit and integration tests for backend functionality.

### Frontend Layer:
- **Milestones**:
  - [ ] Create wireframes or mockups for the user interface.
  - [ ] Define key features:
    - User dashboard with cycling events and betting history.
    - Live updates on race events.
    - Bet placement and management interface.
  - [ ] Choose a frontend framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue).
  - [ ] Build a responsive UI with the defined features.
  - [ ] Integrate with backend APIs for real-time data.
  - [ ] Write unit and end-to-end tests for the frontend.

---

## Phase 3: **Continuous Integration (CI)**
- **Goal**: Automate code integration and testing.
- **Milestones**:
  - [ ] Choose a CI tool (e.g., GitHub Actions).
  - [ ] Write a CI pipeline as code to:
    - Run automated tests.
    - Lint and format code.
    - Generate code coverage reports.
  - [ ] Set up branch protection rules to require CI checks before merging.

---

## Phase 4: **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
- **Goal**: Define and manage infrastructure using code.
- **Milestones**:
  - [ ] Choose an IaC tool (e.g., Terraform, Pulumi, AWS CloudFormation).
  - [ ] Write scripts to provision:
    - A basic production environment.
    - Staging and development environments.
  - [ ] Implement version control for IaC scripts.
  - [ ] Automate infrastructure provisioning through CI/CD.

---

## Phase 5: **Policies as Code**
- **Goal**: Enforce compliance and security policies programmatically.
- **Milestones**:
  - [ ] Choose a policy-as-code tool (e.g., OPA, HashiCorp Sentinel).
  - [ ] Write and enforce policies for:
    - CI/CD pipelines.
    - Infrastructure security.
  - [ ] Integrate policy checks into CI/CD pipelines.

---

## Phase 6: **Continuous Delivery (CD)**
- **Goal**: Automate artifact building and deployment.
- **Milestones**:
  - [ ] Extend the CI pipeline to include:
    - Building application artifacts (e.g., Docker images).
    - Pushing artifacts to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, ECR).
  - [ ] Write CD pipelines to deploy artifacts to staging and production environments.
  - [ ] Implement canary or blue-green deployment strategies.

---

## Phase 7: **Internal Developer Platform (IDP)**
- **Goal**: Provide a self-service platform for developers.
- **Milestones**:
  - [ ] Choose tools for the platform (e.g., Backstage, custom dashboards).
  - [ ] Abstract infrastructure and pipeline complexities using templates or GUIs.
  - [ ] Document how developers can onboard and use the platform.

---

## Phase 8: **Kubernetes**
- **Goal**: Orchestrate containerized applications at scale.
- **Milestones**:
  - [ ] Set up a Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube for local testing).
  - [ ] Use Helm to manage Kubernetes manifests.
  - [ ] Deploy the application to Kubernetes.
  - [ ] Scale the application and monitor resource usage.

---

## Phase 9: **Monitoring & Observability**
- **Goal**: Gain insights into the health, performance, and behavior of your application and infrastructure.
- **Milestones**:
  - [ ] Set up Prometheus and Grafana for real-time metrics.
  - [ ] Implement centralized logging using tools like the ELK Stack.
  - [ ] Use distributed tracing tools like Jaeger or OpenTelemetry.
  - [ ] Set up dashboards and alerts for key metrics and logs.

---

## Phase 10: **Security & Compliance**
- **Goal**: Protect your application, infrastructure, and data from vulnerabilities and threats.
- **Milestones**:
  - [ ] Integrate security scanners like Snyk or Trivy into CI/CD pipelines.
  - [ ] Implement secrets management (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).
  - [ ] Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests.
  - [ ] Enforce compliance requirements with policy-as-code tools.

---

## Phase 11: **Cost Management**
- **Goal**: Optimize resources and minimize expenses.
- **Milestones**:
  - [ ] Integrate cost management tools (e.g., AWS Cost Explorer, GCP Billing Reports).
  - [ ] Identify and eliminate unused or underutilized resources.
  - [ ] Set up alerts for budget overruns.
  - [ ] Document cost optimization strategies.

---

## Phase 12: **Finalization and Continuous Improvement**
- **Goal**: Refine and expand the platform based on feedback.
- **Milestones**:
  - [ ] Collect feedback from users and stakeholders.
  - [ ] Identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.
  - [ ] Regularly update tooling and practices to stay current.
  - [ ] Publish a postmortem or case study of BetCycle's development.
