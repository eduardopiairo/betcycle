# Betcycle Project

A project to explore concepts related to the design and implementation of the deployment pipeline.


The intended deployment pipeline will support application, database and infrastructure changes. 

I will use this project to share my knowledge around the deployment pipeline, explore new approaches, and as support of my talks/presentations/pots/... 

## Deplyment Pipeline

The deployment pipeline has the following stages:

1. Source Control
2. Continuous Integration
3. Continuous Delivery
## Database
