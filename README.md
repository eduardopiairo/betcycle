# BetCycle: A DevOps Quest From Exploration To Production

The purpose of this project is to explore the software development lifecycle through the deployment pipeline.

The deployment pipeline, my favorite technical and cultural tool, will guide us in this quest from writing code in the local environment to the production environment.

Such quest includes the following elements:
- Application
- Deployment pipeline (aka CI/CD) 
- Infrastructure 

During the quest I will add information regarding each of the elements.  

## Application

## Deployment Pipeline

> A deployment pipeline should enable __collaboration__ between the __various groups involved in delivering software__ and provide everyone __visibility about the flow of changes__ in the system, together with a thorough audit trail.
